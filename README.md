`django-rest-live` enables clients which use an API built with [Django REST Framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework) to receive a stream of updates to querysets and model instances over a websocket connection managed by [Django Channels](https://github.com/django/channels). There had been plans for real-time websocket support in REST Framework on a few occasions ([2016](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/community/mozilla-grant/#realtime-apis), [2018](https://groups.google.com/g/django-rest-framework/c/3-QNn3SYlZI/m/Gwx6rFr4BQAJ?pli=1)), but at the time, async support in Django was in the early planning stages and Channels was being [rewritten with breaking API changes](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/2.x/one-to-two.html). 

This plugin aims to bridge the gap between Channels and REST Framework while being as generic and boiler-plate free as possible. Clients are be able to subscribe to real-time updates for any queryset that's exposed through a [Generic API View](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/#genericapiview) or any of its subclasses, including [Model ViewSet](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#modelviewset), with just one mixin!

`django-rest-live` took initial inspiration from [this article by Kit La Touche](https://www.oddbird.net/2018/12/12/channels-and-drf/).
Differently from projects like [`djangochannelsrestframework`](https://github.com/hishnash/djangochannelsrestframework),
`django-rest-live` does not aim to supplant REST Framework for performing CRUD actions through a REST API. Instead,
it is designed to be used in conjunction with HTTP REST endpoints. Clients should still use normal REST framework
endpoints generated by ViewSets and other API views to get initial data to populate a page, as well as any write-driven
behavior (`POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE`). `django-rest-live` gets rid of the need for periodic polling GET
requests to for resource updates after page load.
